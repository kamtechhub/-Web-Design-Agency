# Web Design Agency Website 
 <p>Hi I'm Kamoru AbdulRasak, This project is a simple, modern landing page for a creative design agency. It was built to practice fundamental HTML and CSS concepts, focusing on layout and responsive design.</p>
 
 ## Project Highlights üöÄ
  <p> The main goal of this project was to create a clean, two-column layout using classic CSS techniques. Key features include:</p>

     - Responsive Layout: The design adapts to different screen sizes, providing a great viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

     - CSS float: The two main content cards are positioned side-by-side using the float property.

     - Clearfix: A common practice is used to ensure the footer correctly positions itself below the floated elements, preventing layout issues.

     - Google Fonts: The page uses the Poppins font from Google Fonts for a professional and modern look.

     - Box Model: The layout demonstrates a solid understanding of the CSS box model, including the effective use of margin, padding, and borders.
